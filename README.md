# Bank Statement Analyser

This repository is intended to help students learn test-driven development (TDD) in Python by analyzing bank statement data. 

## About

The `bank_statements.csv` file contains sample bank statement transactions for January 2023. This data can be used to practice writing tests and implementations for functions that analyze the financial data.

Some examples analyses include:

- Calculating total income and expenses
- Summarizing spending by category  
- Identifying top expenses
- Analyzing spending over time

## Using the Repo

Follow these steps to practice TDD with this repository:

1. Fork this repo
2. Review the sample data in `bank_statements.csv`
3. Add test cases in `test_analysis.py` for a function you want to implement 
4. Run the tests and see them fail
5. Add implementation code to `analysis.py` to pass the tests
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for additional functions
7. Push your changes and open a pull request!

This project is intended to create a collaborative learning experience. Pull requests are welcome with additional test cases, function implementations, scripts, documentation, etc. that could help teach TDD with financial data.

Let me know if you would like me to expand or modify this README further!
